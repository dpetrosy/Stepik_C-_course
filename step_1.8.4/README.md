## ðŸ“œ Problem Description

Write a power function that implements the ascension of an integer to a non-negative integer degree. The power function must take two integers as input and return an integer (see code template). When performing the task, note that the function must be called power, the function must not read anything from the input or output.

**Implementation requirements:** in this assignment, you need to implement only the power function. You can define auxiliary functions if you need them. You do not need to implement the main function.

**Restrictions:** the cmath library (and math.h) must not be used.
